# Qiskit Networks
.............. section in  the works ..................................

**Note: Project in the works**

**Qiskit** is an open-source framework for working with noisy quantum computers at the level of pulses, circuits, and algorithms.

Qiskit is made up of elements that work together to enable quantum computing. This element is **Terra** and is the foundation on which the rest of Qiskit is built.

## Installation

We encourage installing Qiskit via the pip tool (a python package manager). The following command installs the core Qiskit components, including Terra.

```bash
pip install qiskit
```

Pip will handle all dependencies automatically and you will always install the latest (and well-tested) version.

To install from source, follow the instructions in the [documentation](https://qiskit.org/documentation/contributing_to_qiskit.html#install-install-from-source-label).
