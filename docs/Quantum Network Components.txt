As a part of this project's creation, we are defining a list of existing Quantum Network components that could be implemented in a future Qiskit Networks protocol library.l
Please see the list bellow
    nodes
    quantum connections
    classical connections
    repeaters
    quantum memory
    switches
    ports (in/out) - within or on top of node architectures
    ...
