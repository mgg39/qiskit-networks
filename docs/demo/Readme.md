## This file consist two type of simulation way: 
### Continuous application all in one python file:  
This able to simulate a large number of node easier, also is easier for development and analysis.  
more example and explaination...

### Descrete application, which each node and settings will have its own seperate file:  
Which can be use for complex simulation as well as use in real application
